# "sch-ai-academy"
In addition to lessons by Jeremy Howard, we will provide lab sessions where the students will discuss and train their own AI models.

The course begins by understanding how to apply deep learning. As the course progresses, the student will dive into more details and get a deeper understanding of AI and deep learning, as well as more practical experience in building machine learning models.

- Cost: Free. A physical copy of the book can be bought and expensed to NRK, if you prefer this.
- Target audience: Software engineers, data engineers and other technologists with some coding experience.
- Expected outcome: A good understanding of AI and deep learning. At the end of the course, the student is able to build AI models and understand a rudimentary way of deploying them.
- Course set-up: The students follow a training program that runs over 9 weeks. The effort is around 4 hours/week. At the end of the course, the students will present an AI project related to their interests or daily work.

## Practical information

- Start: XX December 2022 at 12.00-12.30
- Slack channel used for questions etc: #datascience_og_ml


On [the landing page](https://course.fast.ai/) for the fast.ai course there is a lot of information/ links/ tasks/ tips & tricks. We don't expect you to do everything, so we've gathered instructions for each lesson in the `lessons/` folder. This should be your starting point for the week, with appropriate links and tasks to all material. 


All kinds of questions related to the course can be posted in our slack channel. We also hope that you can help each other solving the tasks of the course. We think teaching others is the best way to learn yourself!

### Weekly plan
When the course starts, we will divide you into groups.

In the `lessons/` folder, you can find all info about how to prepare for the lab sessions, and what to do during the lab sessions.

We recommend working together as a group on all parts of the course (preparation + sessions + project). If parts of the material is unclear, discuss it with your group, and/ or post a question on slack.

During the lab session, you will be able to work on the code together with your group, and get help to understand what you did not understand in the lecture and/or notebook earlier.

We also recommend finishing the lab after the lab session, if there is not enough time during the session to complete the notebook.

Remember that you can always ask questions on the slack group if you have any!
