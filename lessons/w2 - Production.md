## Lab session

### Task 1

Run through, and try to understand what's going on in the notebook of the week:

Kaggle:
[Chapter 2 Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/saving-a-basic-fastai-model/notebook)

Colab:
[Chapter 2 Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/course22/blob/master/02-saving-a-basic-fastai-model.ipynb) (Copy to your drive if you want changes to persist)

### Task 2

In this weeks video, Jeremy shows how you kan create a "HuggingFace Space", and deploy a model as a Gradio (or Streamlit) app. This is a method that is great for showcasing your work, i.e. on HackDays, for pilot-projects and for the student project at the end of this course.

Try to deploy the 'is-it-a-bird'-model, or your own model from last week, and share the link in our slack channel!
