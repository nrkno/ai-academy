# Week 1 - Getting started

Welcome to the first week of the course!

The course material is quite extensive. There's a vast number of things to try out. We've picked out and presented the parts that we think are most importen here in this repo. If you have a lot of time and energy, you are of couse welcome to do more :)


## Before the lab session
Watch Video Lesson 1:
